# Codsoft_Taskno.2_IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION

**Overview:** 
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The classification is based on measurements of the flowers' sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The Iris dataset is a popular choice for introductory classification tasks in machine learning.
